Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in Anesthesiology,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30973516/,10.1097/ALN.0000000000002694," Boston, Massachusetts.",2019,Anesthesiology,"Commercial applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning have made remarkable progress recently, particularly in areas such as image recognition, natural speech processing, language translation, textual analysis, and self-learning. Progress had historically languished in these areas, such that these skills had come to seem ineffably bound to intelligence. However, these commercial advances have performed best at single-task applications in which imperfect outputs and occasional frank errors can be tolerated.The practice of anesthesiology is different. It embodies a requirement for high reliability, and a pressured cycle of interpretation, physical action, and response rather than any single cognitive act. This review covers the basics of what is meant by artificial intelligence and machine learning for the practicing anesthesiologist, describing how decision-making behaviors can emerge from simple equations. Relevant clinical questions are introduced to illustrate how machine learning might help solve them-perhaps bringing anesthesiology into an era of machine-assisted discovery.","Review, Algorithms*, Anesthesiology / methods, Anesthesiology / trends*, Artificial Intelligence / trends*, Humans, Machine Learning / trends*",Review

These pedagogical methods include serious video games and gamification. Serious games are video games utilized as tools for acquiring crucial (serious) knowledge and skills. On the other hand, gamification requires integrating gaming elements (game mechanics) such as points, leaderboards, missions, levels, rewards, and more, into a context that may not be associated with video gaming activities. They can be dynamically (game dynamics) combined developing various strategic approaches. Operatively, gamification adopts simulation elements and leverages the interactive nature of gaming to teach players specific skills, convey knowledge, or address real-world issues. External incentives stimulate internal motivation. Therefore, these techniques place the learners in the central role, allowing them to actively construct knowledge through firsthand experiences.Anesthesia, pain medicine, and critical care demand a delicate interplay of technical competence and non-technical proficiencies. Gamification techniques can offer advantages to both domains. Game-based modalities provide a dynamic, interactive, and highly effective opportunity to learn, practice, and improve both technical and non-technical skills, enriching the overall proficiency of anesthesia professionals. These properties are crucial in a discipline where personal skills, human factors, and the influence of stressors significantly impact daily work activities. Furthermore, gamification can also be embraced for patient education to enhance comfort and compliance, particularly within pediatric settings (game-based distraction), and in pain medicine through stress management techniques. On these bases, the creation of effective gamification tools for anesthesiologists can present a formidable opportunity for users and developers.This narrative review comprehensively examines the intricate aspects of gamification and its potentially transformative influence on the fields of anesthesiology.

Anesthetics were first made possible, then increasingly safe, and now more scalable and efficient in part due to advances in monitoring and delivery technology. Herein, we discuss salient advances of the last three years in the technology of anesthesiology. Consumer technology and telemedicine have exploded onto the scene of outpatient medicine, and perioperative management is no exception. Preoperative evaluations have been done via teleconference, and copious consumer-generated health data is available. Regulators have acknowledged the vast potential found in the transfer of consumer technology to medical practice, but issues of privacy, data ownership/security, and validity remain. Inside the operating suite, monitoring has become less invasive, and clinical decision support systems are common. These technologies are susceptible to the ""garbage in, garbage out"" conundrum plaguing artificial intelligence, but they will improve as network latency decreases. Automation looms large in the future of anesthesiology as closed-loop anesthesia delivery systems are being tested in combination (moving toward a comprehensive system). Moving forward, consumer health companies will search for applications of their technology, and loosely regulated health markets will see earlier adoption of next-generation technology. Innovations coming to anesthesia will need to account for human factors as the anesthesia provider is increasingly considered a component of the patient care apparatus.","Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Review, Anesthesia / trends*, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Security, Confidentiality, Humans, Telemedicine*",Review

This will also enable the continued integration of remote monitoring and control towers having profound effects on coverage and practice models. In the PACU and ICU, the technology will lead to the development of early warning systems that can identify patients who are at risk of complications, enabling early interventions and more proactive care. The integration of augmented reality will allow for better integration of diverse types of data and better decision-making. Postoperatively, the proliferation of wearable devices that can monitor patient vital signs and track their progress will allow patients to be discharged from the hospital sooner and receive care at home. This will require increased use of telemedicine, which will allow patients to consult with doctors remotely.

Unlike classical research methods that are largely inference-based, ML is geared more towards making accurate predictions. ML is a field of artificial intelligence concerned with developing algorithms and models to perform prediction tasks in the absence of explicit instructions. Most ML applications, despite being highly variable in the topics that they deal with, generally follow a common workflow. For classification tasks, a researcher typically tests various ML models and compares the predictive performance with the reference logistic regression model. The main advantage of ML lies in its ability to deal with many features with complex interactions and its specific focus on maximizing predictive performance. However, emphasis on data-driven prediction can sometimes neglect mechanistic understanding. This article mainly focuses on the application of supervised ML to electronic health record (EHR) data. The main limitation of EHR-based studies is in the difficulty of establishing causal relationships. However, the associated low cost and rich information content provide great potential to uncover hitherto unknown correlations. In this review, the basic concepts of ML are introduced along with important terms that any ML researcher should know. Practical tips regarding the choice of software and computing devices are also provided. Towards the end, several examples of successful ML applications in anesthesiology are discussed.

However, little is known about what anesthesiologists know and think about AI in this context. This is important because the successful introduction of new technologies depends on the understanding and cooperation of end users. We sought to investigate how much anesthesiologists know about AI and what they think about the introduction of AI-based technologies into the clinical setting. In order to better understand what anesthesiologists think of AI, we recruited 21 anesthesiologists from 2 university hospitals for face-to-face structured interviews. The interview transcripts were subdivided sentence-by-sentence into discrete statements, and statements were then grouped into key themes. Subsequently, a survey of closed questions based on these themes was sent to 70 anesthesiologists from 3 university hospitals for rating. In the interviews, the base level of knowledge of AI was good at 86 of 90 statements (96%), although awareness of the potential applications of AI in anesthesia was poor at only 7 of 42 statements (17%). Regarding the implementation of AI in anesthesia, statements were split roughly evenly between pros (46 of 105, 44%) and cons (59 of 105, 56%). Interviewees considered that AI could usefully be used in diverse tasks such as risk stratification, the prediction of vital sign changes, or as a treatment guide. The validity of these themes was probed in a follow-up survey of 70 anesthesiologists with a response rate of 70%, which confirmed an overall positive view of AI in this group. Anesthesiologists hold a range of opinions, both positive and negative, regarding the application of AI in their field of work.

We study and compare their performances on both the written and oral portions of the comprehensive and challenging American Board of Anesthesiology (ABA) exam, which evaluates candidates' knowledge and competence in anesthesia practice. In addition, we invited two board examiners to evaluate AI's answers without disclosing to them the origin of those responses. Our results reveal that only GPT-4 successfully passed the written exam, achieving an accuracy of 78% on the basic section and 80% on the advanced section. In comparison, the less recent or smaller GPT-3 and Bard models scored 58% and 47% on the basic exam, and 50% and 46% on the advanced exam, respectively. Consequently, only GPT-4 was evaluated in the oral exam, with examiners concluding that it had a high likelihood of passing the actual ABA exam. Additionally, we observe that these models exhibit varying degrees of proficiency across distinct topics, which could serve as an indicator of the relative quality of information contained in the corresponding training datasets.

Mortality occurs in 5-10% of patients after major surgery and remains a topic of interest. However, the ratio of mortality after postoperative complications in relation to overall complications varies between hospitals because of failure to rescue at the time of the complication. There are multiple factors that lead to complication-related mortality: they are patient-related, disease-related, but are related, above all, to the timeliness of diagnosis of the complication, the organisational aspects of management in private or public hospitals, hospital volume that corresponds to the centralisation of initial management or to the concept of referral centre in case of complications, to the team spirit, to communication between the health care providers and to the management of the complication itself. Several organisational advances are to be considered, such as the development of shorter hospitalisations and notably ambulatory surgery, as well as enhanced recovery programs. Remote monitoring and the contribution of artificial intelligence must also be evaluated in this context. The reduction of mortality after visceral surgery rests on several tactics: prevention of potentially lethal complications, the all-important reduction of failure to rescue, and risk management before, during and after hospitalisations that are increasingly shorter.","Artificial Intelligence, Digestive System Surgical Procedures* / adverse effects, Failure to Rescue, Health Care*, Hospital Mortality, Humans, Postoperative Complications / epidemiology, Postoperative Complications / prevention & control",N/A

In the field of neurosurgery, ANNs have been effectively applied to the diagnosis and prognosis of cerebral tumors, seizures, low back pain, and also to the monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP).","Artificial Intelligence, Humans, Intracranial Hypertension* / surgery, Intracranial Pressure / physiology, Neural Networks, Computer, Optic Nerve / diagnostic imaging, Ultrasonography / methods",N/A

      In older patients receiving general anesthesia, postoperative delirium (POD) is the most frequent form of cerebral dysfunction. Early identification of patients at higher risk to develop POD could provide the opportunity to adapt intraoperative and postoperative therapy.

Drug administration systems may be subdivided into open-loop and closed-loop systems. The techniques applied for design of such systems vary extensively. There are traditional rule-based expert systems and probability-based systems, and more recently developed artificial intelligence methods, such as neural networks and fuzzy logic.

External bodies, such as the American Council of Continuing Medical Education and the American Medical Association, have imposed guidelines in these areas. Methods to evaluate CME activities include retrospective needs analysis based on exit interviews, prospective needs assessment, focus groups, and complex systems such as the CRISIS criteria. Self-directed CME can be evaluated by data collection that identifies how quickly information is received and by the effect of this data on measurable outcome. In the future, CME will increasingly utilize simulators and multimedia computers. Multimedia can bring CME to the physician as opposed to the physician traveling to a CME site.

Data science and machine learning in anesthesiology,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32209960/,10.4097/kja.20124," Seoul, Korea.",2020,Korean J Anesthesiol,"Machine learning (ML) is revolutionizing anesthesiology research. Unlike classical research methods that are largely inference-based, ML is geared more towards making accurate predictions. ML is a field of artificial intelligence concerned with developing algorithms and models to perform prediction tasks in the absence of explicit instructions. Most ML applications, despite being highly variable in the topics that they deal with, generally follow a common workflow. For classification tasks, a researcher typically tests various ML models and compares the predictive performance with the reference logistic regression model. The main advantage of ML lies in its ability to deal with many features with complex interactions and its specific focus on maximizing predictive performance. However, emphasis on data-driven prediction can sometimes neglect mechanistic understanding. This article mainly focuses on the application of supervised ML to electronic health record (EHR) data. The main limitation of EHR-based studies is in the difficulty of establishing causal relationships. However, the associated low cost and rich information content provide great potential to uncover hitherto unknown correlations. In this review, the basic concepts of ML are introduced along with important terms that any ML researcher should know. Practical tips regarding the choice of software and computing devices are also provided. Towards the end, several examples of successful ML applications in anesthesiology are discussed. The goal of this article is to provide a basic roadmap to novice ML researchers working in the field of anesthesiology.","Anesthesiology / statistics & numerical data*, Blood Glucose / metabolism, Data Interpretation, Statistical*, Data Science / methods, Data Science / statistics & numerical data*, Databases, Factual / statistics & numerical data*, Diabetes Mellitus / blood, Diabetes Mellitus / diagnosis, Electronic Health Records / statistics & numerical data*, Humans, Machine Learning / statistics & numerical data*, Blood Glucose",N/A

      Artificial intelligence was born to allow computers to learn and control their environment, trying to imitate the human brain structure by simulating its biological evolution. Artificial intelligence makes it possible to analyze large amounts of data (big data) in real-time, providing forecasts that can support the clinician's decisions. This scenario can include diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment in anesthesiology, intensive care medicine, and pain medicine. Machine Learning is a subcategory of AI. It is based on algorithms trained for decisions making that automatically learn and recognize patterns from data. This article aims to offer an overview of the potential application of AI in anesthesiology and analyzes the operating principles of machine learning Every Machine Learning pathway starts from task definition and ends in model application.","Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence*, Humans, Machine Learning*, Prognosis",N/A

Comparative analysis of popular predictors for difficult laryngoscopy using hybrid intelligent detection methods,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36451753/,10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e11761," Limerick, Ireland.",2022,Heliyon,"Difficult laryngoscopy is associated with airway injury, and asphyxia. There are no guidelines or gold standards for detecting difficult laryngoscopy. There are many opinions on which predictors to use to detect difficult laryngoscopy exposure, and no comprehensively unified comparative analysis has been conducted. The efficacy and accuracy of deep learning (DL)-based models and machine learning (ML)-based models for predicting difficult laryngoscopy need to be evaluated and compared, under the circumstance that the flourishing of deep neural networks (DNN) has increasingly left ML less concentrated and uncreative. For the first time, the performance of difficult laryngoscopy prediction for a dataset of 671 patients, under single index and integrated multiple indicators was consistently verified under seven ML-based models and four DL-based approaches. The top dog was a simple traditional machine learning model, Naïve Bayes, outperforming DL-based models, the best test accuracy is 86.6%, the F1 score is 0.908, and the average precision score is 0.837. Three radiological variables of difficult laryngoscopy were all valuable separately and combinedly and the ranking was presented. There is no significant difference in performance among the three radiological indicators individually (83.06% vs. 83.20% vs. 83.33%) and comprehensively (83.74%), suggesting that anesthesiologists can flexibly choose appropriate measurement indicators according to the actual situation to predict difficult laryngoscopy.

Machine learning of EEG spectra classifies unconsciousness during GABAergic anesthesia,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33956800/,10.1371/journal.pone.0246165," MA, United States of America.",2021,PLoS One,"In current anesthesiology practice, anesthesiologists infer the state of unconsciousness without directly monitoring the brain. Drug- and patient-specific electroencephalographic (EEG) signatures of anesthesia-induced unconsciousness have been identified previously. We applied machine learning approaches to construct classification models for real-time tracking of unconscious state during anesthesia-induced unconsciousness. We used cross-validation to select and train the best performing models using 33,159 2s segments of EEG data recorded from 7 healthy volunteers who received increasing infusions of propofol while responding to stimuli to directly assess unconsciousness. Cross-validated models of unconsciousness performed very well when tested on 13,929 2s EEG segments from 3 left-out volunteers collected under the same conditions (median volunteer AUCs 0.99-0.99). Models showed strong generalization when tested on a cohort of 27 surgical patients receiving solely propofol collected in a separate clinical dataset under different circumstances and using different hardware (median patient AUCs 0.95-0.98), with model predictions corresponding with actions taken by the anesthesiologist during the cases. Performance was also strong for 17 patients receiving sevoflurane (alone or in addition to propofol) (median AUCs 0.88-0.92). These results indicate that EEG spectral features can predict unconsciousness, even when tested on a different anesthetic that acts with a similar neural mechanism. With high performance predictions of unconsciousness, we can accurately monitor anesthetic state, and this approach may be used to engineer infusion pumps to intelligibly respond to patients' neural activity.","Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Anesthetics, Intravenous / pharmacology, Brain / drug effects, Brain / physiopathology, Electroencephalography* / drug effects, Humans, Machine Learning*, Male, Sevoflurane / adverse effects, Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted*, Unconsciousness / chemically induced, Unconsciousness / physiopathology*, Anesthetics, Intravenous, Sevoflurane",N/A

Protocol for the perioperative outcome risk assessment with computer learning enhancement (Periop ORACLE) randomized study,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37547785/,10.12688/f1000research.122286.2,N/A,2022,F1000Res,"Background: More than four million people die each year in the month following surgery, and many more experience complications such as acute kidney injury. Some of these outcomes may be prevented through early identification of at-risk patients and through intraoperative risk mitigation. Telemedicine has revolutionized the way at-risk patients are identified in critical care, but intraoperative telemedicine services are not widely used in anesthesiology. Clinicians in telemedicine settings may assist with risk stratification and brainstorm risk mitigation strategies while clinicians in the operating room are busy performing other patient care tasks. Machine learning tools may help clinicians in telemedicine settings leverage the abundant electronic health data available in the perioperative period. The primary hypothesis for this study is that anesthesiology clinicians can predict postoperative complications more accurately with machine learning assistance than without machine learning assistance. Methods: This investigation is a sub-study nested within the TECTONICS randomized clinical trial (NCT03923699). As part of TECTONICS, study team members who are anesthesiology clinicians working in a telemedicine setting are currently reviewing ongoing surgical cases and documenting how likely they feel the patient is to experience 30-day in-hospital death or acute kidney injury. For patients who are included in this sub-study, these case reviews will be randomized to be performed with access to a display showing machine learning predictions for the postoperative complications or without access to the display. The accuracy of the predictions will be compared across these two groups. Conclusion: Successful completion of this study will help define the role of machine learning not only for intraoperative telemedicine, but for other risk assessment tasks before, during, and after surgery.

However, little is known about what anesthesiologists know and think about AI in this context. This is important because the successful introduction of new technologies depends on the understanding and cooperation of end users. We sought to investigate how much anesthesiologists know about AI and what they think about the introduction of AI-based technologies into the clinical setting. In order to better understand what anesthesiologists think of AI, we recruited 21 anesthesiologists from 2 university hospitals for face-to-face structured interviews. The interview transcripts were subdivided sentence-by-sentence into discrete statements, and statements were then grouped into key themes. Subsequently, a survey of closed questions based on these themes was sent to 70 anesthesiologists from 3 university hospitals for rating. In the interviews, the base level of knowledge of AI was good at 86 of 90 statements (96%), although awareness of the potential applications of AI in anesthesia was poor at only 7 of 42 statements (17%). Regarding the implementation of AI in anesthesia, statements were split roughly evenly between pros (46 of 105, 44%) and cons (59 of 105, 56%). Interviewees considered that AI could usefully be used in diverse tasks such as risk stratification, the prediction of vital sign changes, or as a treatment guide. The validity of these themes was probed in a follow-up survey of 70 anesthesiologists with a response rate of 70%, which confirmed an overall positive view of AI in this group. Anesthesiologists hold a range of opinions, both positive and negative, regarding the application of AI in their field of work.

Twelve medical students (novices) and eight senior anesthesiology trainees (experts) were included in the study. Experts reported significantly lower cognitive load (P < 0.001) and outperformed novices based on the observational checklist (P < 0.001). EEG signatures differed significantly between the experts and novices. Experts showed a greater increase in delta and theta band amplitudes, especially in temporal and frontal locations and in right occipital areas for delta. A machine learning algorithm showed 83.3 % accuracy for expert-novice skill classification using the selected EEG features. Performance scores were positively correlated (P < 0.05) with event-related amplitudes for delta and theta bands at locations where experts and novices showed significant differences. Increased delta and frontal/midline theta oscillations on EEG suggested that experts had better attentional control than novices.

Comparative analysis of popular predictors for difficult laryngoscopy using hybrid intelligent detection methods,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36451753/,10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e11761," Limerick, Ireland.",2022,Heliyon,"Difficult laryngoscopy is associated with airway injury, and asphyxia. There are no guidelines or gold standards for detecting difficult laryngoscopy. There are many opinions on which predictors to use to detect difficult laryngoscopy exposure, and no comprehensively unified comparative analysis has been conducted. The efficacy and accuracy of deep learning (DL)-based models and machine learning (ML)-based models for predicting difficult laryngoscopy need to be evaluated and compared, under the circumstance that the flourishing of deep neural networks (DNN) has increasingly left ML less concentrated and uncreative. For the first time, the performance of difficult laryngoscopy prediction for a dataset of 671 patients, under single index and integrated multiple indicators was consistently verified under seven ML-based models and four DL-based approaches. The top dog was a simple traditional machine learning model, Naïve Bayes, outperforming DL-based models, the best test accuracy is 86.6%, the F1 score is 0.908, and the average precision score is 0.837. Three radiological variables of difficult laryngoscopy were all valuable separately and combinedly and the ranking was presented. There is no significant difference in performance among the three radiological indicators individually (83.06% vs. 83.20% vs. 83.33%) and comprehensively (83.74%), suggesting that anesthesiologists can flexibly choose appropriate measurement indicators according to the actual situation to predict difficult laryngoscopy. Adaptive spatial interaction was imposed to the model to boost the performance of difficult laryngoscopy prediction with preoperative cervical spine X-ray.",,N/A
